# Marta config

[Marta Docs](https://marta.sh/docs/)

How to config: [config](https://marta.sh/docs/configuration/editor/)

The [.marta-conf](.marta-conf) file contains the current config.  

Since I do not know where this file is located, I cannot do the update scripting. Have to copy the config manually.
